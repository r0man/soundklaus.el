  Play music on [[https://soundcloud.com][SoundCloud]] with [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] via [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emms][EMMS]].

** Prerequisites

   This mode requires [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] 24, [[http://curl.haxx.se][curl]] to stream tracks, [[http://ibiblio.org/mp3info][mp3info]] to tag
   them, and a music player that is supported by /EMMS/. [[http://www.musicpd.org][Music Player
   Daemon]], [[https://www.mplayerhq.hu/design7/news.html][MPlayer]] and [[http://www.videolan.org][VLC Media Player]] are known to work with
   /soundklaus.el/.

** Installation

   /soundklaus.el/ is available on [[http://melpa.milkbox.net][MELPA]].  Instructions on how to
   configure /MELPA/ can be found [[http://melpa.milkbox.net/#/getting-started][here]]. After configuring /MELPA/ you can
   install /soundklaus.el/ with the following command:

   =M-x package-install [RET] soundklaus [RET]=

   If you are using [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]] to manage your [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] packages, you can
   install and autoload /soundklaus.el/ with the following code:

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (use-package soundklaus
       :ensure t
       :commands
       (soundklaus-activities
        soundklaus-connect
        soundklaus-my-favorites
        soundklaus-my-playlists
        soundklaus-my-tracks
        soundklaus-playlists
        soundklaus-tracks))
   #+END_SRC

** Configuration

   This mode requires a working [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emms][EMMS]] setup for Emacs. The following
   code from the /EMMS/ [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emms/quickstart.html][Quick-Start Guide]] should get you started.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (require 'emms-setup)
     (emms-standard)
     (emms-default-players)
   #+END_SRC

** Usage

   You can search songs with =M-x soundklaus-tracks= and playlists
   with =M-x soundklaus-playlists=. Your own tracks and playlists are
   available with =M-x soundklaus-my-tracks= and =M-x
   soundklaus-my-playlists=. You can list your favorite tracks with
   =soundklaus-my-favorites=. In the =*soundklaus*= buffer you can move
   to the next song with =C-n= or =n=, and to the previous one with
   =C-p= or =p=. Pressing =RET= plays the current song, and =a= adds
   the current song at point to the /EMMS/ playlist. All other
   available key bindings can be seen with =M-x describe-minor-mode
   [RET] soundklaus-mode=.

** Authentication

   Some commands like =M-x soundklaus-activities= or =M-x
   soundklaus-my-tracks= need access to your /SoundCloud/ account. Your
   web browser should open Emacs via =emacsclient= for the [[http://oauth.net/2][OAuth2]]
   callback URL =soundklaus://oauth/callback=.

   On a Linux system you can configure this by running =M-x
   soundklaus-desktop-entry-save=. This will write the following
   content to the =~/.local/share/applications/soundklaus.desktop=
   file in your home directory.

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    [Desktop Entry]
    Name=SoundKlaus
    Exec=emacsclient %u
    Icon=emacs-icon
    Type=Application
    Terminal=false
    MimeType=x-scheme-handler/soundklaus;
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   Next, make sure your Emacs runs as a server. You can do this by
   adding this to your Emacs configuration.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (unless (server-running-p)
       (add-hook 'after-init-hook 'server-start t)))
   #+END_SRC

   Now you can start the [[http://oauth.net/2][OAuth2]] authentication dance with =M-x
   soundklaus-connect=. You should get redirected to /SoundCloud/ and
   allow /soundklaus.el/ to access your account. After pressing the
   =Connect= button on the /SoundCloud/ page, the browser should open
   Emacs and set the =soundklaus-access-token= customization variable.

   To setup this functionality on other operating systems take a look
   at the [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-protocol.html#sec-3][system setup]] section in [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-protocol.html][org-protocol.el]] and adapt it for
   /soundklaus.el/.
